world... Soon you'll know why.

Finally I got some time to write here... It's not obvious, but Mind 
Booster Networks is still moving, working hardly... We have a new BBS that 
is now the place where we should start posting, and you givving your 
feedback/(questions/support/whatever... Just post. We are feeling a lack 
of members: we all have our studies and personal projects, two of us left 
all side projects, but there'as a lot of work being done... I (Mind 
Booster) am working full time to finish SELVA III (the substitute of 
Selva II - our Portuguese talker), and giving a look (less than I should) 
on scalc... HellRaiser is working to the software section - that is 
growing widely: new version of scalc, NoIdle (in developement) and so 
on... And still he has to treat of his home Network... (New machines, 
lot's of work). Vampiric_Crow is full of University projects, and still 
he's working good on making a new WebPage (witch the beta is already real 
nice!) and we hope we'll see it online soon... Mb3gg is dedicated in his 
(lots of) side projects, although he will try to get some time and arrange 
the code of some programs he made and GPL them so we can put them on the 
Web Page... So, as we can see, we're not stopped, we're not dead. We're 
full of work and doing it, and we're needing more people... If you feel 
like you fit in, just drop us a line. Cheers, Mind Booster.
