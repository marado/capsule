= Time Capsule =

In 2000 I decided to create a "time capsule" to show how my web page was 20
years in the past. I maintained it from five years, presenting to you a window
to two decades prior. With time passing, even 20 years doesn't seem too much,
so instead I'm going to turn that capsule into a "century timeline": from 2000
to the current day.

== The plan ==

=== Sources ===

* Use the 'old time capsule's git history to capture what went on between 2000 and 2005
* https://mindboosternoori.blogspot.com/ for what went on from 2005 to 2020
* http://marado.github.io/friendfeed-backup/ for what went on from 2008 to 2015
* https://marado.github.io/Gplus-backup/ for what went on from 2011 to 2019
* twtxt-200x.txt for what went on from 2007 to nowadays
* https://tilde.pt/~marado/blog/all_posts.html for what went on from 2020 to nowadays

=== Format ===

* Undecided: but maybe an html page linking to the right places?
